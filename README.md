 To achieve the business objective, I suggest the client focus on:

Content Diversification: Expand the genres that are popular and have high IMDb/ TMDB scores, such as Drama, Comedy, and Thriller, to attract a wider audience.

Focus on Popular Content: Invest in producing or acquiring shows and movies that have a high number of IMDb votes, as these are likely to be more popular with viewers.

Target Specific Demographics: Based on age ratings and genres, target specific viewer demographics to create content that matches their preferences, thus increasing engagement and retention.

Data-Driven Decisions: Regularly analyze content performance (ratings, votes, popularity) and adapt the content library to maintain audience interest and grow subscriptions.

This strategy will enhance customer satisfaction, improve user engagement, and foster content investment that leads to positive business growth.
