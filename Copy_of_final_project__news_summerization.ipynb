It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brand divisions. The event took place on October 4, 2009, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. It replaced the previously annual October PPV, No Mercy. This was the only Hell in a Cell event to feature the ECW brand, as it was disbanded in February 2010.\n",

        "There were eight matches scheduled on the event's card, as well as one dark match that occurred before the live broadcast. The event featured what was known as a supercard, which featured more than one main event match. The concept of the event was that each of these main event matches would be contested as Hell in a Cell matches. The main events included D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) defeating The Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase), Randy Orton defeating John Cena to win the WWE Championship, and The Undertaker defeating CM Punk to win the World Heavyweight Championship.\n",

This event would also be the final time Jim Ross called as part of WWE's commentary team full-time for a pay-per-view event and began part-time commentary onwards. The pay-per-view drew 283,000 buys, up from the 261,000 buys No Mercy 2008 received.'''\n",
