        "In the rapidly growing digital streaming industry, platforms like Amazon Prime Video are constantly expanding their content libraries to cater to diverse global audiences. This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the TV shows and movies available on Amazon Prime Video, focusing on content trends, viewer ratings, and production patterns. The dataset analyzed includes over 9,000 unique titles and more than 124,000 actor/director credits, sourced specifically for the United States region.\n",
        "\n",
        "Objective\n",
        "The main objective of this project is to uncover data-driven insights from Amazon Prime’s catalog that can assist content strategists, business analysts, and production teams in understanding user preferences, content diversity, and performance metrics. The analysis aims to address key questions such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "What genres dominate the platform?\n",
        "\n",
        "How has content distribution evolved over the years?\n",
        "\n",
        "What are the most common age certifications?\n",
        "\n",
        "How do IMDb scores and popularity correlate?\n",
        "\n",
        "Who are the most frequent contributors (actors/directors)?\n",
        "\n",
        " Dataset Description\n",
        "The project uses two CSV files:\n",
        "\n",
        "titles.csv – Contains metadata of shows and movies such as title name, release year, runtime, age certification, genres, IMDb score, TMDB score, and production countries.\n",
        "\n",
        "credits.csv – Lists actor and director credits associated with each title, including character names and roles.\n",
        "\n",
        " Data Preparation\n",
        "The data was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and standardize formats. Null values in key columns such as age_certification, runtime, and description were filled with reasonable defaults (e.g., \"Not Rated\", median runtime, etc.). Columns like genres and production_countries, which were stored as strings, were parsed into Python lists for better handling. Outliers in runtime were addressed using quantile thresholds.\n",
        "\n",
        " Key Analyses & Visualizations\n",
        "Several exploratory analyses and visualizations were performed using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The major findings include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Content Type Distribution: The platform is movie-heavy, with approximately 75% of the content being movies and the rest TV shows.\n",
        "\n",
        "Top Genres: Drama, Comedy, Action, and Thriller are the most dominant genres, suggesting viewer interest in emotionally engaging and high-paced content.\n",
        "\n",
        "Release Year Trend: There has been a steady increase in the number of releases, especially from 2018 onwards, indicating a growing investment in original and third-party content.\n",
        "\n",
        "Age Certification: A large number of titles are rated either \"Not Rated\" or \"TV-MA\", reflecting a focus on mature audiences.\n",
        "\n",
        "IMDb Score Distribution: IMDb scores for most titles range between 5.5 and 7.5, suggesting generally average-to-good reception. Higher scores often correlate with increased TMDB popularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Production Countries: The United States leads by a significant margin, followed by India, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\n",
        "\n",
        "Credits Analysis: The actor-director data reveals that a small number of actors and directors appear frequently, indicating recurring collaborations or popular casting choices.\n",
        "\n",
        " Business Insights\n",
        "The insights derived from this analysis have direct business value:\n",
        "\n",
        "Content Strategy: Emphasis on drama and action content can attract more users.\n",
        "\n",
        "Target Audience: The dominance of adult-rated content shows the need for diverse age-targeted programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regional Focus: Encouraging more international content could help expand Prime’s global reach.\n",
        "\n",
        "Talent Management: Recognizing frequently cast actors and directors can help strengthen brand identity through familiar faces.\n",
        "\n",
        " Conclusion\n",
        "This project provides a solid foundation for understanding how Amazon Prime Video curates and distributes its content. By leveraging data, streaming platforms can make informed decisions about what to produce, license, or promote, ultimately improving user engagement and subscription growth. The findings of this analysis can guide not only content development but also marketing and audience targeting strategies in a highly competitive streaming landscape.\n",

        "\n",
        "Distribution of Continuous Data:\n",
        "\n",
        "IMDb scores are continuous numerical values, ranging from 0 to 10. A Histogram is the best chart to visualize the distribution of continuous data, as it groups the scores into intervals (bins) and shows how frequently titles fall into each interval. This helps in identifying patterns like whether scores are concentrated around a particular value or spread across a wide range.\n",
        "\n",
        "Identification of Skewness:\n",
        "\n",
        "The histogram allows us to easily see if the IMDb scores are skewed in any direction. For example, are most of the titles rated around the higher end (e.g., 7-10), or do they tend to be clustered at the lower end (e.g., 0-3)? This kind of insight helps identify content quality trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "Smoothness of Distribution:\n",
        "\n",
        "Adding the KDE curve helps smooth out the histogram and shows a continuous estimate of the probability density function of the scores. The KDE provides a clearer view of the overall shape of the distribution, helping to spot areas of concentration more easily. This is important because it reveals underlying trends that might be missed with just the histogram alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Clarity and Interpretability:\n",
        "\n",
        "A histogram is intuitive and easy to interpret for most audiences. It can clearly show whether the distribution is normal, skewed, or if there are any outliers or extreme ratings. This allows the stakeholders to quickly assess the quality of content available on the platform in terms of user ratings."

If Movies have a higher median score compared to TV Shows, this would indicate that, on average, Movies receive higher ratings than TV Shows.

If Movies have a narrower IQR, it indicates that the ratings for Movies are more consistent across titles. Conversely, a wider IQR for TV Shows may suggest greater variability in how TV Shows are rated by audiences, with some shows being highly rated and others receiving lower ratings.\n",
